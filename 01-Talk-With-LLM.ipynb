      "=====================================\n",
      "\n",
      "An autoencoder is a type of neural network that is used for unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and generative modeling. It consists of two main components:\n",

      "1. **Encoder**: This is the mapping from the input to a lower-dimensional representation, often called the bottleneck or latent representation.\n",
      "2. **Decoder**: This is the mapping from the lower-dimensional representation back to the original input.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Architecture**\n",

      "1. **Training**: The autoencoder is trained on a dataset, where the input is fed into the encoder, and the output of the encoder is fed into the decoder.\n",
      "2. **Loss Function**: The loss function measures the difference between the input and the reconstructed output. The most common loss function used is mean squared error (MSE) or cross-entropy.\n",
      "3. **Optimization**: The parameters of the autoencoder are optimized to minimize the loss function using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.\n",

      "4. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: This is a type of autoencoder that learns a probabilistic representation of the input data.\n",
